1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,440
Do you see this viral photo?

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:03,580
Did you see this right here?

3
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:15,720
These kindergartners, they're best friends and they had twin day at school, so they wanted to dress alike on twin day.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,820
And so here they are, please welcome Miles and Tanner and their moms, Brittany and Latina.

5
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:29,520
Okay, Brittany, what's the story behind the photo?

6
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:45,600
Well, it was Red Ribbon Week at school and it was twin day and so Miles really wanted to dress like Tanner and he was adamant that they looked identical and that they had the same hair and the same eyes, right?

7
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,380
He just, that's what he saw.

8
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:49,960
Yes, exactly.

9
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:51,200
We got the same eyes.

10
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,660
Same eyes, same hair.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,200
All right, so what happened the next day at school?

12
00:00:56,231 --> 00:01:01,060
Well, the night before I never heard of Tanner, I met Tanner.

13
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,260
Oh, you'd never met him?

14
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:17,540
No, and so I started stalking everyone in our town to try and find his mother, because I texted the teacher and she did give me Tanner's mother's name, just common courtesy, like I'm gonna send some clothes tomorrow for your kid to change into.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,460
I need you to be on board with me, you know?

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:32,060
And so he did, so we sent the clothes to school and he went and changed as soon as he got there and then the teacher had sent us that picture, and the boys, and I was like, aww.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,880
So you had no idea who Tanner was?

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,600
No, not at all.

19
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:43,740
You just bought the clothes because your boy came in and said, I got the dude at school, we got the same eyes, same hair, everything.

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Hey, Tanner, Tanner, Tanner?

21
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:48,000
 Yes.

22
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:52,280
Why is Miles your twin?

23
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,060
Because he wanna be my friend.

24
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:02,800
And Miles, why did you tell your mom that he was your twin?

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,880
Yeah, he was my best friend.

26
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:06,420
He's your best friend.

27
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,800
So y 'all twins, that's all that matters.

28
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:12,320
We're both five.

29
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:13,020
 Huh?

30
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,300
We're both five.

31
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,540
Oh, you're both five?

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,080
Well, that, hell, that do it right there.

33
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:22,720
Oh my God.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,160
Oh my God.

35
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:32,280
Why do you think that many, LaKindra and Brittany, why do you think so many people love this story that it went viral?

36
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:39,520
I think in the media today, we see a lot of not the best stories, I guess you could say.

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,260
And so, okay.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,640
You tripping.

39
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:49,080
Oh no, Kip.

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,580
You had no good story.

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,680
You tripping.

42
00:02:56,035 --> 00:03:00,520
I think it just was a breath of fresh air for people to see something sweet and so innocent.

43
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:08,340
Let me ask y 'all something.

44
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:11,680
Have y 'all had a talk with them about it?

45
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:15,500
You haven't explained to them that that's.

46
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:20,380
No, but they act like they're brothers and they call themselves brothers, so we just.

47
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:21,160
Let it go.

48
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,580
 Yeah.

49
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,420
Yeah, we're not gonna point out the differences.

50
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:24,600
That defeats the purpose.

51
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:25,800
Cause they don't see none.

52
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:26,460
That's right.

53
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,980
Because you know, so.

54
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:33,460
You know why?

55
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:35,500
Because kids don't see difference.

56
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,240
They're taught differences.

57
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:43,060
If you go to any playground, you see all the kids playing together.

58
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:47,900
You don't see until they get older, them separating.

59
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,420
That group over here eating.

60
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,080
That other group over there eating.

61
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:53,060
You don't see that.

62
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,580
Cause they get taught to them.

63
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:55,800
That's what.

64
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,140
If we could learn from kids, man.

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,460
Man, this world be a show cooler place, man.

66
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,840
This really, really, really, really.

67
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:16,060
Well, hey fellas, I wanna thank you for all of us, how to live.

68
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:23,180
I think that you two are the best friends.

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,840
I think you look just alike.

70
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,780
I love the fact that you're twins and y 'all should stay friends forever.

71
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,920
And have a good life.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,820
And thank y 'all for coming.

73
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,340
Thank you.

74
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:42,540
Both of y 'all, thank you very much.
